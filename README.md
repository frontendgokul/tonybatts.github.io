## My portfolio site
https://www.tonybatts.com/

I built this site from the ground up using JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5. I decided to develop without the use of frameworks or a CMS like WordPress to show that I can create a fully responsive website without having a CMS do all of the heavy lifting for me. A solid understanding of how things work is a must for a developer.

My portfolio is a progressive web app (PWA) This means that you can download it onto your device, and it will work when there is no internet available as well as some other cool stuff under the hood. This site is hosted on github pages, meaning I have no access to the .htaccess file. This limitation made optimizing my site a creative task. I was still able to achieve straight 100’s on my lighthouse audit. I treat my portfolio like a playground, if I have a ridiculous idea in the middle of the night I’ll pop out of bed and code it into my site.

While I was building this portfolio I occasionally started to add easter eggs, little hidden gems that I thought would make people happy if they were to stumble across one. I started with 1. Then 1 turned into 2, and now there are currently 8 easter eggs hidden throughout this website. I will likely end up adding more if a new idea pops up, I've had a lot of fun creating them. If you end up looking for all 8 and need a hint feel free to ask me, or crack open the dev tools and poke around!

## Todo app
https://www.tonybatts.com/todo

This web app is built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5. For this project I utilized modern tools to make cleaner/more maintainable code. I used npm, webpack, and babel to insure that this app works on any browser new or old. This app utalizes localStorage to make sure your todos are saved when you close out your browser. Thanks to webpack I was able to also utilize JavaScript modules, I've included a "src" folder with the non compiled modules in this repository. During my work hours I found myself constantly typing in todos for myself in a text editor throughout the day and figured I might as well make an actual app that will be easier to read and help my daily work flow. I have the webapp downloaded to my computer and open during my work hours, it has been a great addition to my workflow.
